This SDK is independent of any Framework. It uses PSR Request/Response/HttpClient to be usable cross framework.

## Symfony Bundle

If you are using Symfony, you can use the [Symfony Bundle](https://github.com/shopware/AppBundle) to integrate the SDK.
See Getting Started of the Bundle for more information.
